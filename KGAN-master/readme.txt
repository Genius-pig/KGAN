### Dataset
1. Book-Crossing.
2. MOOCCube, http://moocdata.cn/data/MOOCCube. sorry for only being able to provide a link to the dataset here, I'll upload the code on how to pre-process that dataset later, 
   or maybe you can refer to that mentions it in the paper first.


### Required packages
The code has been tested running under Python 3.6, with the following packages installed (along with their dependencies):
- tensorflow-gpu == 1.10.0
- numpy == 1.21.4
- sklearn == 1.0.1
- keras == 2.2
